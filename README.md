# blog
as an old, fantastic, and overthinking developer I have so many ideas, tricks, roadmaps, and code snippets I founded and developed that I wanted to publish for the public, wanted to leave it in the coding community before I retire. Although I and the programming world are rapidly developing and these blog posts might not be useful after I write them, for this reason I made the contributing open to anyone for information editing and adding new posts. The blog might inspire me to learn new things to teach and it will help me if I created a post that needs extra explanation.

# the structure
to ensure that every post is:
- [] Translateable
- [] anyone could comment, and comments can only be changed by the author
- [] contributable
- [] posts has more data than title and body
- [] likeable

so, we need to follow this guide to accurately create a post:
- [] make the post in a directory named with the slug of the post
- [] any MD file inside the repository is considered a translation of the post. The main language is arabic
- [] create the lodash file, which is a file named _ or _.json that contains JSON object with extra post data
- [] create a discussion in the discussions tab with the name that exactly matches the slug (for like counting and commenting)

Notes:
- the first h1 title in the MD file is considered the main title of the post
- some features of MarkDown work on ayman.ee/blog but doesn't on github
- any github user is an automatic user of the website
- likes taken from the reactions on the discussing opened for commenting

# contribution
this is an open source project, I'll be glad if you want to be a part of this repository. Use Notion for writing MD in a better way. But any translation shouldn't be made with translators, it should be done proffesionally and in a way that transfare the VERY EXACT idea to the reader

# Why on github
I'm too lazy to create a backend, all the features are in github and much more.

# Early versions of the idea
these three repositories are private right now, because they have SO MANY problems and Ä±naccurate information.
**the how-to Repository**
simply, gists. I created it because I didn't know that github gists existed.
every post came from how-to will have how-to golden tag
**successfull dev guide Repository**
It's a guide aims to succeed developers in life by taking the most advantage from coding. It's some explanations and information about hiring, productivity, and softskills and more
**Developer Roadmaps Project**
I have trained and mentored many developers, and I know how to progress a developer knowledge and I had created SO MANY ROADMAPS that I need to post.
