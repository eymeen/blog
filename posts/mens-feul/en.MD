# Men's feul

I don't know a person that has built wealth, power, personality or intelligence without being fould of this fuel, the miracle fuel came from Allah subhanahu wataala that losers hate. You should Embrace this feeling and force ourselves to get addicted to it, if we (non-gifteds) didn't force ourselves to get this feeling on purpose, we'll be lose. And mostly we won't need to "force" ourselves get it.

### what is it
it's a angry + sad or maybe 'depressed' feeling. It comes when you want something every man needs and don't have it. Examples can be like having a crush on a girl that ignores you, really liking a motor/car and not having it, having an awesome very close friend company that's rare and trustfull. The feeling will ONLY hit you when you see someone else have it and you don't, or someone else use that particular thing against you will also multiplize the fuel inside of you. Nothing else will maximize this fuel in you except it. Or you can truely imagine seeing someone else having these things:
1. Attractive personal traits
2. Power
   1. Government Power
   2. Physical Power
   3. Tongue Power
   4. Social Power
   5. Financial Power
3. Family
4. Friends
5. Your Crush
6. ...

### Turn Offs
any extra dopamine will make you feel better, and this is never good. because it will go from the fire inside of you to periodical happiness which is from seconds to hours only then you'll feel SAD depressed we need ANGRY to work. So if you feel that feeling, don't smoke, drink, eat choclates, touch yourself, drink redbull AND don't vent or try to show how much you're sad about your situation, not that NOBODY cares (and it's true btw) it's about the fuel leak you have vent you vent


### how to use it
although the fuel feels bad, lighting it will feel like hell, but you'll see a difference even if you work just for one day. It only takes 2 to 5 years to be the ultimate master of any/all of the things I mentioned earlier. 


### what if I don't light it but also don't vent
figuratively, since fuel never expires, you'll continue living a very bad depressed life.
